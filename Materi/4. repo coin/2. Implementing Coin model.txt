1. Inside our model folder, create a coin.dart file that will contain our Coin model. Initialize it as a simple class.

        class Coin{

        }

2. Inside the class our model will contain the ticker, full name of the currency, its price, and an image as fields. There will also be more information that we will use later in the coin page to display more details about the coin. Feel free to copy this snippet for the fields and the constructor
        class Coin {
        final String ticker;
        final String fullName;
        final double price;
        final String imageUrl;

        final String algorithm;
        final num blockNumber;
        final num blockTime;
        final num blockReward;
        final String assetLaunchDate;
        final num maxSupply;

        const Coin({
            required this.ticker,
            required this.fullName,
            required this.price,
            required this.imageUrl,
            required this.algorithm,
            required this.blockNumber,
            required this.blockTime,
            required this.blockReward,
            required this.assetLaunchDate,
            required this.maxSupply,
        });

        }

3. We will also have a factory that will generate a CryptoCurrency from a Map (JSON format) that gets from the request. Just remember that the information we get in the factory method is very dependent on the format the API sends to us. You normally get the information from documentation or testing a request for yourself. This is called the request schema. Feel free to look at the schema they provide with this picture:

4. The factory code looks like this. Make sure it is still inside the class. This method will convert the information coming from the API into a Coin object that we can use.
        
        factory Coin.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
            return Coin(
            fullName: map['CoinInfo']?['FullName'] ?? '',
            ticker: map['CoinInfo']?['Name'] ?? '',
            price: (map['RAW']?['USD']?['PRICE'] ?? 0).toDouble(),
            // ignore: prefer_interpolation_to_compose_strings
            imageUrl: "https://cryptocompare.com" + map['CoinInfo']?['ImageUrl'],
            algorithm: map['CoinInfo']?['Algorithm'] ?? '',
            blockNumber: map['CoinInfo']?['BlockNumber'] ?? 0,
            blockTime: map['CoinInfo']?['BlockTime'] ?? 0,
            blockReward: map['CoinInfo']?['BlockReward'] ?? 0,
            assetLaunchDate: map['CoinInfo']?['AssetLaunchDate'] ?? '',
            maxSupply: map['CoinInfo']?['MaxSupply'] ?? 0,
            );
        }
